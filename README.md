TV Survival

Objective
The objective is to determine the lifespan of Vizio TVs. Lifespan is determined as time that elapses between when the TV is activated for the first time (TV DoB) and the time when there is no longer any detection for a 12-month period – in other words, 1 year active.

High Level Summary
The Inactive TVs analyzed represent 11% of the TVs eligible for this analysis and are unrepresentative of the overall Inactive population. The average age of deactivated TVs is 20 months. This is likely down to the failure of older chipsets and the introduction of improved SMART TV technology, which prompted early adopters to decommission their existing TVs. More recent chipset data is not yet available for the timeframe needed to test this hypothesis. 

However, 89% of TVs analyzed, remain active, which points to robustness of Vizio TVs. In fact, there is a 73% chance that the TV will be active after 46 months of life. It would be safe to use a 6 year average lifespan for a Vizio TV.

Limitations
There was one major limiting factor that impeded this analysis – although more than enough TVs were eligible (~6.5m), these TVs spanned a time window that was not long enough.

This is highlighted by the fact that, of the TVs eligible for this analysis, 11% are inactive versus 89% active. Clearly, not enough time has elapsed for TVs to go through their natural life cycle. For those TVs that are inactive, the average life for these TVs is 20 months, versus 25 months, for those still active TVs. The TVs that are inactive are more representative of that small percentage of TVs that become inactive for a reason other than their natural life cycle of a wider TV population.
